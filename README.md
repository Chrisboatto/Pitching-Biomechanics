# Pitching-Biomechanics

Over the past 20 years, baseball has seen a massive transformation. We've gone from pitchers who would use pin point location with an ability to change speeds, to fireballers…but has it? 

Using the Driveline open source data base found on their Github page here, I began my introduction to biomechanics. After pulling meta and points of interest datasets from their page and cleaning it, I began with basic correlations to determine what leads to velocity.
